# Loot Export
A simple addon to help copy+paste raid loot rolls

After defeating a boss and rolling on loot, simply type /lootexport or /le to open a popup window with a summary. You can then copy+paste that text wherever you'd like. Can be useful for guilds to keep track of a history of loot distribution.
